## Basic Usage: Renaming and Moving Files

At its core, `mv` performs two primary functions: renaming files and moving files from one location to another.

**Renaming a file:**

To rename a file, simply use the command with the old name and the new name:

```bash
mv old_file_name.txt new_file_name.txt
```

This will rename `old_file_name.txt` to `new_file_name.txt` within the current directory.

**Moving a file:**

To move a file to a different directory, specify the source and destination paths:

```bash
mv source_file.txt /path/to/destination/directory/
```

This moves `source_file.txt` from its current location to the `/path/to/destination/directory/`.  Note that the destination directory must exist.  If `source_file.txt` already exists in the destination directory, it will be overwritten without warning.

**Example:**

Let's say you have a file named `my_document.txt` in your current directory and want to move it to a directory called `Documents` located in your home directory.  The command would be:

```bash
mv my_document.txt ~/Documents/
```


## Moving Multiple Files

`mv` can efficiently handle multiple files simultaneously. You can move multiple files into a single directory using wildcards or by listing each file individually:

**Using wildcards:**

```bash
mv *.txt /path/to/destination/
```

This moves all files ending in `.txt` in the current directory to `/path/to/destination/`.

**Listing files individually:**

```bash
mv file1.txt file2.jpg file3.pdf /path/to/destination/
```

This moves `file1.txt`, `file2.jpg`, and `file3.pdf` to `/path/to/destination/`.


## Moving Directories

Moving directories works similarly to moving files, but requires careful consideration.

```bash
mv source_directory /path/to/destination/
```

This moves the entire `source_directory` and its contents to `/path/to/destination/`. Again, the destination directory must exist, and overwriting will occur without a prompt if a directory with the same name already exists at the destination.


##  Overwriting Files: The `-i` Option

To prevent accidental overwriting, use the `-i` (interactive) option.  This will prompt you for confirmation before overwriting an existing file:


```bash
mv -i source_file.txt /path/to/destination/
```

Now, if `source_file.txt` already exists at the destination, `mv` will ask:

```
mv: overwrite ‘/path/to/destination/source_file.txt’? 
```


##  Force Overwriting: The `-f` Option

The opposite of `-i` is `-f` (force). This option will overwrite existing files without any confirmation:

```bash
mv -f source_file.txt /path/to/destination/
```


## Advanced Usage: Combining Options

You can combine options for more control. For example, to force overwrite multiple files interactively you might use:

```bash
mv -i -f *.txt /path/to/destination/ 
```

This example is a bit counter-intuitive and not commonly used, as using `-f` will override the interactive prompt of `-i`.  It's generally recommended to choose either `-i` or `-f` rather than combining them.


##  Error Handling

`mv` will return a non-zero exit status if it encounters an error, such as trying to move a file to a non-existent directory or encountering permission issues. Checking the exit status is important in scripting environments.


##  Important Note on Permissions

Ensure you have the necessary permissions to move files and directories.  If you lack the appropriate permissions, the `mv` command will fail.  You might need `sudo` privileges for operations involving system directories or files.
