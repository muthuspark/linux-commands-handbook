## Understanding Routing Tables

Before diving into the commands, let's briefly understand routing tables.  These tables act as a directory for your system's network connections, mapping destination networks to the interfaces and gateways needed to reach them. When your system needs to send data to a destination, it consults the routing table to determine the best path.

## Key `ip route` Commands and Options

The `ip route` command offers a wealth of options, allowing you to view, add, delete, and modify routing entries. Let's look at some common commands and their usage:

### 1. Viewing Routing Tables

The simplest use of `ip route` is to display the current routing table:

```bash
ip route
```

This will output a list of routes, including the destination network, netmask, gateway, and interface.


### 2. Adding Static Routes

Adding a static route is essential for directing traffic to networks not automatically discovered by your system.  The syntax is as follows:

```bash
ip route add <destination> via <gateway> dev <interface>
```

For example, to add a route to the 192.168.1.0/24 network via the gateway 192.168.0.1 using the `eth0` interface:

```bash
sudo ip route add 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.0.1 dev eth0
```

You'll need `sudo` privileges to modify routing tables.  The `/24` denotes the subnet mask.


### 3. Deleting Routes

Removing a route is equally important for network management. The command is:

```bash
sudo ip route del <destination> via <gateway> dev <interface>
```

To delete the route added in the previous example:

```bash
sudo ip route del 192.168.1.0/24 via 192.168.0.1 dev eth0
```


### 4. Specifying Metric

Routes can have associated metrics, influencing route selection. Lower metrics are preferred.

```bash
sudo ip route add 10.0.0.0/8 via 10.10.10.1 dev eth1 metric 20
```

This adds a route to 10.0.0.0/8 with a metric of 20.


### 5. Default Gateway

Setting a default gateway directs all traffic not explicitly routed otherwise:

```bash
sudo ip route add default via 192.168.0.1 dev eth0
```

This sets 192.168.0.1 as the default gateway on the `eth0` interface.


### 6.  Showing specific routes

You can filter the output by specifying a particular destination or interface

```bash
ip route show to 192.168.1.0/24
ip route show dev eth0
```


### 7. Using `ip route list` (synonym for `ip route show`)

`ip route list` functions identically to `ip route show`.  It provides the same functionality with a slightly different command syntax.


These examples illustrate some core `ip route` functionalities.  Exploring the `man ip-route` page provides a complete reference to all its capabilities, including advanced features like policy routing and route tables manipulation.  Understanding and utilizing `ip route` is critical for effective Linux network administration.
