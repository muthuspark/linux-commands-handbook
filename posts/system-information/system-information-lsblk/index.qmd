## What is `lsblk`?

`lsblk` (list block devices) is a simple yet powerful command-line utility used to display information about block devices on a Linux system.  These block devices represent storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, partitions, and even loop devices (used for mounting image files).  Unlike commands like `fdisk` which modify partitions, `lsblk` is purely for informational purposes.

## Basic Usage

The simplest way to use `lsblk` is to run it without any options:

```bash
lsblk
```

This will output a table showing the block devices, their mount points (if mounted), and some key properties.  You'll see information like:

* **NAME:** The device name (e.g., `/dev/sda`, `/dev/sdb1`).
* **RM:**  Removable status (yes/no).
* **SIZE:** The size of the device.
* **TYPE:**  The type of device (e.g., disk, part).
* **MOUNTPOINT:** Where the device is mounted (if applicable).

## Exploring `lsblk` Options

`lsblk` offers many options to customize the output and tailor it to your specific needs:

### `-l` (List)

This option provides a more concise, single-line output, perfect for scripting or when you need a quick overview:

```bash
lsblk -l
```

The output will show key information in a compact format, omitting some less critical details.

### `-f` (Full Output)

The `-f` option provides more details than the default output. This includes the filesystem type of each partition:

```bash
lsblk -f
```

This is extremely useful for identifying the filesystem on various partitions.

### `-o` (Output Columns)

This option allows you to specify which columns are displayed.  You can list multiple columns separated by commas.  For example, to only show the NAME and SIZE:

```bash
lsblk -o NAME,SIZE
```

You can find a complete list of available columns in the `lsblk` man page (`man lsblk`).


### `-n` (No headers)

Suppress the header line from the output. This is handy when parsing the output with other commands:

```bash
lsblk -n
```


### `-p` (Print all)

This option will display all partitions, even those that are not in use:

```bash
lsblk -p
```

###  Filtering with `-e` and `-t`


* `-e <type>`: allows you to specify the types of devices to list (e.g., `-e part` for partitions only)
* `-t <type>`: opposite of `-e`, this filters to show only devices of a specified type (e.g., `-t disk` for disks only).

Example showing only partitions:

```bash
lsblk -e part
```

Example showing only disks:

```bash
lsblk -t disk
```


These options provide a significant level of control over the output of `lsblk`, making it a tool for managing and monitoring your Linux system's block devices. By combining these options effectively, you can extract precisely the information you need in the format you prefer.
