## What is htop?

`htop` is an interactive text-mode process viewer for Linux, a powerful alternative to the standard `top` command. Unlike `top`, which requires constant scrolling to view all processes, `htop` offers a dynamic, navigable interface.  You can scroll through processes, sort by various metrics, kill processes, and even change process priorities â€“ all without leaving the command-line.


## Installation

`htop` is not typically included in minimal Linux installations.  To install it, you'll need to use your distribution's package manager. Here are examples for some popular distributions:

* **Debian/Ubuntu:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install htop
  ```

* **Fedora/CentOS/RHEL:**
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install htop
  ```

* **Arch Linux:**
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S htop
  ```

Once installed, simply type `htop` in your terminal and press Enter to launch the application.


## Navigating the htop Interface

The `htop` interface displays information in a clear, organized manner. Key elements include:

* **Top Section:** Displays system-wide statistics like CPU usage (per core), memory usage, swap space, and load average.
* **Main Section:** Shows a list of running processes with their PID, user, CPU and memory usage, and more.
* **Bottom Section:** Provides navigation instructions and quick access to commands.

##  Key Navigation Commands

* **Arrow Keys:** Navigate up and down the process list.
* **Spacebar:**  Sorts processes by CPU usage (cycles).
* **F6:**  Switch between different sorting options (e.g., CPU%, MEM%, PID, etc.).
* **F4:**  Filter processes by name or part of a name. (Type your filter, then press Enter)
* **K:** Send a KILL signal (SIGTERM) to a selected process. This politely requests the process to terminate.
* **Shift+K:** Send a KILL signal (SIGKILL) to a selected process. This forces the process to terminate.  Use with caution!
* **H:** Shows the tree view of processes, highlighting parent-child relationships
* **F2:**  Change settings (colors, display options).


##  Example: Monitoring CPU Usage

Let's say you suspect a specific process is consuming excessive CPU resources.  After launching `htop`, you can:

1. **Identify the process:** Use the arrow keys to navigate to the suspect process in the process list.  Observe its CPU % usage.
2. **Sort by CPU usage:** Press the `Spacebar` to sort the list by CPU percentage, making high-CPU consumers easier to spot.
3. **Kill the process (if necessary):** If the process is unresponsive or misbehaving, press `K` (SIGTERM) or `Shift+K` (SIGKILL) to terminate it.


## Example: Analyzing Memory Usage

Similar to CPU monitoring, you can effectively analyze memory usage with `htop`.

1. **Sort by memory usage:** Press `F6` to select "MEM%" as the sorting criteria. This displays the processes consuming the most RAM at the top.
2. **Identify memory leaks:**  If you see processes consistently consuming large amounts of RAM, investigate potential memory leaks within those applications.


## Example: Filtering Processes

Finding a specific process in a long list can be tedious.  `htop`'s filtering feature is helpful:

1. **Press F4:**  This activates the filter input field.
2. **Enter a filter string:** For instance, if you are searching for a process named 'chrome', type 'chrome' and press Enter. `htop` will display only processes containing 'chrome' in their name.


##  Beyond the Basics


`htop` offers many more features, including customizable display settings, interactive process management, and real-time monitoring.  Exploring its options through the help menu (usually accessible via `F1`) is highly recommended for advanced usage.  Its intuitive interface and powerful features make it an indispensable tool for any Linux system administrator or developer.
