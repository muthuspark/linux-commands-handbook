## What is `vgdisplay`?

The `vgdisplay` command is a powerful tool within the LVM suite.  It displays detailed information about a specified volume group (VG). A volume group is a collection of Physical Volumes (PVs) that are grouped together to create a larger pool of storage.  Think of it as a container for your logical volumes (LVs), which are the actual partitions you use for data.

Without `vgdisplay`, navigating and understanding your LVM setup would be significantly more difficult.

## Basic Usage

The simplest form of `vgdisplay` is just typing the command itself:

```bash
sudo vgdisplay
```

This will display information about *all* volume groups on your system. The output will include details such as:

* **VG Name:** The name of the volume group.
* **VG Size:** The total size of the volume group.
* **PE Size:** The size of each Physical Extent (PE), which is the basic unit of storage within a VG.
* **#PE:** The total number of Physical Extents.
* **Free PE:** The number of free PEs available for creating new logical volumes.
* **VG Status:** The overall status of the volume group (e.g., active, inactive).

This provides a quick overview of your LVM configuration.

## Displaying Information for a Specific Volume Group

To get information about a *specific* volume group, you need to provide the volume group name as an argument:

```bash
sudo vgdisplay myvg
```

Replace `myvg` with the actual name of your volume group. This command will only display information for `myvg`.

## Understanding the Output

Let's break down a sample output:

```
--- Volume group ---
VG Name               myvg
System ID             
Format                lvm2
Metadata Areas        1
Metadata Sequence No  2
VG Access             read/write
VG Status             resizable
MAX LV                0
Cur LV                1
Open LV               1
Max PV                0
Cur PV                2
Act PV                2
VG Size               <20.00 GiB
PE Size               4.00 MiB
Total PE              5120
Alloc PE / Size       1024 / <10.00 GiB
Free  PE / Size       4096 / <10.00 GiB
VG UUID               ... (UUID here)
```

This output tells us:

* The volume group is named `myvg`.
* It's using the lvm2 format.
* It currently has 2 physical volumes.
* It has a total size of just under 20 GiB and 10 GiB are allocated.
* There are 4096 free PEs available.

##  Filtering Output with `grep`

For more specific information, combine `vgdisplay` with the `grep` command. For example, to only see the VG size:

```bash
sudo vgdisplay myvg | grep 'VG Size'
```

This will output only the line containing "VG Size." You can adapt this to filter for any other piece of information displayed by `vgdisplay`.


##  Advanced Usage:  Combining with other LVM commands

`vgdisplay` is often used in conjunction with other LVM commands, such as `vgs`, `lvs`, and `pvs`, to get a holistic view of your storage configuration. For instance, after identifying a volume group of interest with `vgs`, you can use `vgdisplay` to drill down to see its specific details.


By mastering `vgdisplay`, you gain a crucial tool in managing and troubleshooting your Linux system's storage.  Its straightforward syntax and comprehensive output make it an indispensable command for any system administrator.
