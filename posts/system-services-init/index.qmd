## Understanding Systemd Units

Before diving into commands, let's grasp the fundamental concept of Systemd *units*.  These are configuration files that describe a service, target, or device.  They reside in `/etc/systemd/system/` (and other locations). Each unit file has a specific extension: `.service` for services, `.target` for groups of units, and so on.

## Common `systemctl` Commands

The `systemctl` command is your primary tool for interacting with Systemd. Here are some essential commands with examples:

**1. Listing Services:**

To see all active services, use:

```bash
systemctl list-units
```

This provides a list of all loaded and active units, their status (active, inactive, failed), and load state.  Filtering is possible:

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service
```

This shows only services.

**2. Starting, Stopping, and Restarting Services:**

Let's say we want to manage the SSH service (usually `ssh`).

* **Start:**

```bash
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

This starts the SSH service. The `sudo` is crucial because managing services often requires root privileges.

* **Stop:**

```bash
sudo systemctl stop ssh
```

This stops the SSH service.

* **Restart:**

```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```

Restarts the SSH service gracefully.

* **Reload:**

```bash
sudo systemctl reload ssh
```
This reloads the configuration of the running service without restarting. Useful if you've changed the configuration file.


**3. Checking Service Status:**

To check the status of a service:

```bash
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

This provides detailed information about the service, including its status, active state, and logs.

**4. Enabling and Disabling Services:**

* **Enable:**

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ssh
```

This ensures the service starts automatically on boot.

* **Disable:**

```bash
sudo systemctl disable ssh
```

This prevents the service from starting automatically on boot.


**5.  Working with Service Files:**

Understanding the structure of a service file is crucial for customization.  A basic service file might look like this:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=My Custom Service
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=myuser
Group=mygroup
ExecStart=/path/to/my/service/script

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

* `[Unit]`: Describes the service and its dependencies.
* `[Service]`: Defines how the service runs.  `ExecStart` specifies the command to run.
* `[Install]`:  Specifies when the service should be started.

Remember to replace placeholders like `/path/to/my/service/script`, `myuser`, and `mygroup` with your actual values. After creating this file (e.g., `/etc/systemd/system/my-custom-service.service`), you need to reload the daemon and enable/start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable my-custom-service
sudo systemctl start my-custom-service
```


**6. Viewing Logs:**

Systemd provides a convenient way to view service logs:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u ssh
```

This shows the logs specifically for the SSH service.  `journalctl -xe` displays recent system logs across all units.


These examples provide a solid foundation for managing Linux services with Systemd.  Further exploration into Systemd's capabilities, including timers, sockets, and more, will significantly enhance your Linux administration skills.
